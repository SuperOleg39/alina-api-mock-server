## Prerequisites

Before running the mock server, you'll need to make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Node.js v16 or later
- npm or yarn

## Running the Project Locally

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
- Install the project dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install`.
- Start the server by running npm start or yarn start.

The server should now be running at `http://localhost:4000`.

## Using Swagger

We've included Swagger in this project to make it easy for you to interact with the server's API. Here's how you can use it:

- Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4000/api-docs`.
- You should now see the Swagger UI, which provides a user-friendly interface for exploring the server's API.
- You can use Swagger to send requests to the server, and view the server's responses.
